## Motivation
My motivation to create this was to have fun with my Photon that was in his box for a while.
I'm also into the crypto world, and I decided to create a tool that helps me without being the whole time accessing to exchanges or to stocks dashboards.
Another good reason is that I had always the problem that I could not see all the cryptocurrencies that I wanted in different currency values (EUR, BTC, USD, etc) at once.

## How it works
This crypto tracker is connected to the internet and works with the particle.io infraestructure, using the Webhooks functionality as well as the remote console for deploying the code in your Photon.
The data is fetched from an external free [API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api#explore-api)
